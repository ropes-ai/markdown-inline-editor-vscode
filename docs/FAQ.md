# FAQ

## Decorations Not Showing?

1. **Check file extension** – Ensure file is `.md`
2. **Toggle decorations** – Click the toolbar button or use `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Toggle Markdown Decorations"
3. **Reload window** – `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"
4. **Check extension status** – Verify extension is activated in the Extensions view

## Why is there a sidebar button in the activity bar?

The extension adds a "Markdown Inline" button in VS Code's activity bar (left sidebar). This button hosts a hidden webview that's required for rendering Mermaid diagrams inline. The webview is never visible to you—it runs in the background to process Mermaid code blocks.

**You can safely ignore this button.** It doesn't provide any user-facing functionality and is purely a technical requirement for Mermaid diagram rendering. The button appears because VS Code requires a view container for webviews, even when they're hidden.

If you don't use Mermaid diagrams, the button still appears but remains inactive.

## Performance Issues?

- **Large files** – Files over 1MB may experience slower parsing
- **Temporarily disable** – Use the toolbar button or command palette to toggle decorations off
- **Check performance** – `Help` → `Startup Performance` to diagnose issues
- **Report issues** – If performance is consistently poor, please [open an issue](https://github.com/SeardnaSchmid/markdown-inline-editor-vscode/issues) with details (see [README](README.md#reporting-bugs) for reporting format)
